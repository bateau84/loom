description: "Idiomatic exception handling in Python — catching narrowly, custom exception hierarchies, exception chaining with `raise ... from`, try/except/else/finally, context managers for cleanup, re-raising vs wrapping, EAFP vs LBYL, and mapping domain errors to HTTP responses. Use when designing error flow, defining custom exceptions, handling failures from I/O or external APIs, deciding what to catch, or cleaning up resources reliably. Also use when the user mentions exceptions, try/except, raise, error handling, or custom errors in Python."

> **House skill.** Follow `python-common-practice` and `current Loom role directive and control-plane state`. Pairs with `python-fastapi` (HTTP mapping), `python-async` (CancelledError), `python-observability` (logging errors).

**Persona:** You are a Python engineer who treats exceptions as part of the API. You catch what you can handle and let the rest propagate to someone who can.

# Error Handling

Python prefers **EAFP** ("easier to ask forgiveness than permission") — try the operation and handle the exception rather than pre-checking. Pre-checks race with reality; the exception is the truth.

```python
# ✓ EAFP — one atomic attempt
try:
    return cache[key]
except KeyError:
    return load(key)

# ✗ LBYL — racy for I/O; fine when a simple guard avoids broad catching
if key in cache:
    return cache[key]
```

**OQ6 qualification — EAFP is a Python convention, not a universal rule.** In agent-maintained code, a too-broad `except` that succeeds silently compounds across agentic workflows in a way a human would catch but an agent won't. Prefer EAFP where the exception type is unambiguous and the catch is narrow; prefer LBYL where catching narrowly would require guessing at a framework hierarchy.

## Catch narrowly

Catch the **specific** exception you can handle. A bare `except:` or `except Exception:` swallows bugs, `KeyboardInterrupt`, and (in async) cancellation — turning a crash you'd fix into silent wrong behavior.

```python
# ✗ Bad — hides programming errors and makes debugging impossible
try:
    sync_playlist(p)
except Exception:
    pass

# ✓ Good — handle the failures you expect; let the rest surface
try:
    sync_playlist(p)
except (httpx.HTTPError, TimeoutError) as e:
    log.warning("sync failed for %s: %s", p.id, e)
    metrics.errors_total.inc()
```

If you must catch broadly (a top-level worker loop that must not die), log with `log.exception(...)` to capture the traceback, then continue or re-raise — never `pass`.

## Agent navigability — narrow exception surfaces

Prefer narrow exception surfaces: agents catching from broad hierarchies must guess error object shapes — a predictable interface failure, not a model failure.

**Framework guidance — catch the specific exception, not the family:**

| Framework | Broad (avoid) | Narrow (prefer) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `requests` / `httpx` | `requests.exceptions.RequestException` | `httpx.TimeoutException`, `httpx.HTTPStatusError` |
| `django` ORM | `django.core.exceptions.ObjectDoesNotExist` | `MyModel.DoesNotExist` |
| SQLAlchemy | `sqlalchemy.exc.SQLAlchemyError` | `sqlalchemy.exc.IntegrityError`, `sqlalchemy.exc.OperationalError` |

Wrap framework exceptions at the boundary into domain exceptions. This collapses the broad hierarchy into a predictable, narrow surface for all downstream code.

## Custom exceptions — a hierarchy with a common base

Give your package one base exception; specific errors subclass it. Callers can then catch the whole family or a specific case. This is what lets a FastAPI handler map *all* your domain errors in one place.

```python
class SortarrError(Exception):
    """Base for all sortarr domain errors."""

class AuthRequiredError(SortarrError): ...
class QuotaExceededError(SortarrError): ...
```

Subclass the most specific stdlib type when it fits (`ValueError`, `LookupError`); invent a new hierarchy only for domain concepts the stdlib doesn't model.

## Chain exceptions — preserve the cause

When you wrap a low-level error in a domain one, use `raise ... from` so the original traceback survives. Bare `raise NewError(...)` inside an `except` hides the root cause.

```python
try:
    resp = await client.get(url)
    resp.raise_for_status()
except httpx.HTTPStatusError as e:
    raise QuotaExceededError("YouTube quota hit") from e   # ✓ keeps the cause
```

To deliberately suppress the context, use `from None` — and only when the cause is genuinely noise.

This is also how you keep storage details out of the API: the **repository** catches the driver error and raises a domain error, so the route never imports `sqlite3` or sees a driver exception.

```python
import sqlite3

def save_rule(self, rule: Rule) -> None:
    try:
        self._con.execute("INSERT INTO rules (id, pattern) VALUES (?, ?)", (rule.id, rule.pattern))
    except sqlite3.IntegrityError as e:
        raise DuplicateRuleError(rule.id) from e   # domain error — a handler maps it to 409
```

## else and finally

`else` runs only when `try` didn't raise — put success logic there. `finally` always runs; prefer a **context manager** over manual try/finally.

```python
with open_connection(db_path) as conn:   # closed on any exit path
    conn.execute(...)
```

Write your own with `contextlib.contextmanager` or `__enter__/__exit__`; use `async with` for async resources.

## Re-raise, don't return error sentinels

Returning `None`/`-1`/`False` to signal failure forces every caller to remember to check, and the type checker can't help. Raise instead — the failure can't be silently ignored. (Return `X | None` only when "not found" is a *normal, expected* outcome, not an error.)

In async code, **never swallow `asyncio.CancelledError`** — re-raise it so shutdown and timeouts work (→ See `python-async`).

## Mapping to HTTP

In FastAPI, register one exception handler per domain base class rather than try/except in every route (→ See `python-fastapi`):

```python
@app.exception_handler(AuthRequiredError)
async def _auth(_: Request, exc: AuthRequiredError):
    return JSONResponse(status_code=401, content={"detail": str(exc)})
```

Never leak a stack trace or internal message to a client — log the detail server-side, return a clean message.

## Common mistakes

| Mistake | Fix |
| --- | --- |
| `except Exception: pass` | Catch the specific type; if broad, `log.exception` then re-raise. |
| Bare `raise FooError()` inside `except` | `raise FooError() from err` to preserve the cause. |
| `except:` (bare) | Catches `KeyboardInterrupt`/`SystemExit`/cancellation too — name the type. |
| Manual try/finally for cleanup | Use a context manager (`with`). |
| Returning `None`/`-1` for errors | Raise an exception; reserve `None` for expected absence. |
| Swallowing `CancelledError` in async | Re-raise it. |
| Leaking tracebacks to API clients | Log server-side; return a sanitized message. |
| EAFP with broad `except` on a framework hierarchy | Prefer LBYL guard or narrow catch; wrap at the boundary into a domain exception. |

**Diagnose:** 1- `ruff check` (bugbear `B`) — flags overly broad `except` and `raise` without `from` 2- read the full traceback (don't truncate) — the chained `from` cause usually names the real failure.
